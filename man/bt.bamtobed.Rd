\usage{
bt.bamtobed(
  i,
  bedpe = NULL,
  mate1 = NULL,
  bed12 = NULL,
  split = NULL,
  splitD = NULL,
  ed = NULL,
  tag = NULL,
  color = NULL,
  cigar = NULL,
  output = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{i}{<bam>}

\item{bedpe}{Write BEDPE format.
- Requires BAM to be grouped or sorted by query.}

\item{mate1}{When writing BEDPE (-bedpe) format, 
always report mate one as the first BEDPE "block".}

\item{bed12}{Write "blocked" BED format (aka "BED12"). Forces -split.
http://genome-test.cse.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format1}

\item{split}{Report "split" BAM alignments as separate BED entries.
Splits only on N CIGAR operations.}

\item{splitD}{Split alignments based on N and D CIGAR operators.
Forces -split.}

\item{ed}{Use BAM edit distance (NM tag) for BED score.
- Default for BED is to use mapping quality.
- Default for BEDPE is to use the minimum of
  the two mapping qualities for the pair.
- When -ed is used with -bedpe, the total edit
  distance from the two mates is reported.}

\item{tag}{Use other NUMERIC BAM alignment tag for BED score.
- Default for BED is to use mapping quality.
  Disallowed with BEDPE output.}

\item{color}{An R,G,B string for the color used with BED12 format.
Default is (255,0,0).}

\item{cigar}{Add the CIGAR string to the BED entry as a 7th column.}

\item{output}{Output filepath instead of returning output in R.}
