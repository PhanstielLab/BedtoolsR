\usage{
bt.pairtobed(
  a,
  b,
  abam = NULL,
  ubam = NULL,
  bedpe = NULL,
  ed = NULL,
  f = NULL,
  s = NULL,
  S = NULL,
  type = NULL,
  output = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{<bedpe>}

\item{b}{<bed/gff/vcf>}

\item{abam}{The A input file is in BAM format.  Output will be BAM as well. Replaces -a.
- Requires BAM to be grouped or sorted by query.}

\item{ubam}{Write uncompressed BAM output. Default writes compressed BAM.
is to write output in BAM when using -abam.}

\item{bedpe}{When using BAM input (-abam), write output as BEDPE. The default
is to write output in BAM when using -abam.}

\item{ed}{Use BAM total edit distance (NM tag) for BEDPE score.
- Default for BEDPE is to use the minimum of
  of the two mapping qualities for the pair.
- When -ed is used the total edit distance
  from the two mates is reported as the score.}

\item{f}{Minimum overlap required as fraction of A (e.g. 0.05).
Default is 1E-9 (effectively 1bp).}

\item{s}{Require same strandedness when finding overlaps.
Default is to ignore stand.
Not applicable with -type inspan or -type outspan.}

\item{S}{Require different strandedness when finding overlaps.
Default is to ignore stand.
Not applicable with -type inspan or -type outspan.}

\item{type}{Approach to reporting overlaps between BEDPE and BED.
either Report overlaps if either end of A overlaps B.
  - Default.
neither Report A if neither end of A overlaps B.
both Report overlaps if both ends of A overlap  B.
xor Report overlaps if one and only one end of A overlaps B.
notboth Report overlaps if neither end or one and only one 
  end of A overlap B.  That is, xor + neither.
ispan Report overlaps between [end1, start2] of A and B.
  - Note: If chrom1 <> chrom2, entry is ignored.
ospan Report overlaps between [start1, end2] of A and B.
  - Note: If chrom1 <> chrom2, entry is ignored.
notispan Report A if ispan of A doesn't overlap B.
   - Note: If chrom1 <> chrom2, entry is ignored.
notospan Report A if ospan of A doesn't overlap B.
   - Note: If chrom1 <> chrom2, entry is ignored.}

\item{output}{Output filepath instead of returning output in R.}
