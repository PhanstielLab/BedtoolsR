  i,
  files,
  s = NULL,
  S = NULL,
  f = NULL,
  tag = NULL,
  names = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{i}{<BAM>}

\item{files}{FILE1 .. FILEn}

\item{s}{Require overlaps on the same strand.  That is, only tag alignments that have the same
strand as a feature in the annotation file(s).}

\item{S}{Require overlaps on the opposite strand.  That is, only tag alignments that have the opposite
strand as a feature in the annotation file(s).}

\item{f}{Minimum overlap required as a fraction of the alignment.
- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)}

\item{tag}{Dictate what the tag should be. Default is YB.
- STRING (two characters, e.g., YK)}

\item{names}{Use the name field from the annotation files to populate tags.
By default, the -labels values are used.}

\item{scores}{Use the score field from the annotation files to populate tags.
By default, the -labels values are used.}

\item{intervals}{Use the full interval (including name, score, and strand) to populate tags.
Requires the -labels option to identify from which file the interval came.}

\item{labels}{LAB1 .. LABn}

\item{output}{Output filepath instead of returning output in R.}
