\arguments{
\item{i}{<bed/gff/vcf>}

\item{g}{<genome>}

\item{excl}{A BED/GFF/VCF file of coordinates in which features in -i
should not be placed (e.g. gaps.bed).}

\item{incl}{Instead of randomly placing features in a genome, the -incl
options defines a BED/GFF/VCF file of coordinates in which 
features in -i should be randomly placed (e.g. genes.bed). 
Larger -incl intervals will contain more shuffled regions. 
This method DISABLES -chromFirst.}

\item{chrom}{Keep features in -i on the same chromosome.
- By default, the chrom and position are randomly chosen.
- NOTE: Forces use of -chromFirst (see below).}

\item{seed}{Supply an integer seed for the shuffling.
- By default, the seed is chosen automatically.
- (INTEGER)}

\item{f}{Maximum overlap (as a fraction of the -i feature) with an -excl
feature that is tolerated before searching for a new, 
randomized locus. For example, -f 0.10 allows up to 10 percent
of a randomized feature to overlap with a given feature
in the -excl file. **Cannot be used with -incl file.**
- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)}

\item{chromFirst}{Instead of choosing a position randomly among the entire
genome (the default), first choose a chrom randomly, and then
choose a random start coordinate on that chrom.  This leads
to features being ~uniformly distributed among the chroms,
as opposed to features being distribute as a function of chrom size.}

\item{bedpe}{Indicate that the A file is in BEDPE format.}

\item{maxTries}{Max. number of attempts to find a home for a shuffled interval
in the presence of -incl or -excl.
Default = 1000.}

\item{noOverlapping}{Don't allow shuffled intervals to overlap.}

\item{allowBeyondChromEnd}{Allow shuffled intervals to be relocated to a position
in which the entire original interval cannot fit w/o exceeding
the end of the chromosome.  In this case, the end coordinate of the
shuffled interval will be set to the chromosome's length.
By default, an interval's original length must be fully-contained
within the chromosome.}

\item{output}{Output filepath instead of returning output in R.}
